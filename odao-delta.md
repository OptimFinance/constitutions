# Constitution of The Council, Delta


## Preamble

The Council exists in order to provide a perspective of a group of people only interested to make as much money as possible from the system. It achieves this by taking care of the treasury and dynamic funding needed by the protocols which fund ODAO. Focus on what is, see what can be. Enable the Core. Embrace the Court.


# Article I -- The Ethos

## Section 1.1

Change and aid those around you, for alone you can affect nothing. 

## Section 1.2

The only meaningful truth is one that is acted upon.

## Section 1.3

The fear and greed cycle repeats ad infinitum. 

## Section 1.4

See the direction, understand the change, feel its momentum. 


# Article II -- The Pathos

## Section 2.1

The power granted to the delta is to manage the treasury, custodial assets, and flow of assets for ODAO as a whole. Dynamic funding and matching it to a responsible, duration matched, investment is the core philosophy.

## Section 2.2

Every change made must be disclosed and able to be discussed no less than 2 weeks in advance. Exceptions to this rule may only be made when an immediate disclosure or any delay would cause the loss of assets of any who used a previously recognized protocol. 

## Section 2.3 

The delta shall discuss new investment strategies specifically within itself. There is no need to make the public aware of treasury investments until post-implementation, to prevent front-running. 

## Section 2.4

The delta is not compensated by the token released by the alpha. The delta should be focusing on the overall health and longevity of ODAO as a whole. 


# Article III -- The Logos

## Section 3.1

The delta follows a board of directors structure, where DAOs (whether it be an citizen or incorporated DAO under ODAO) serve as members, with a 1 vote per 1 entity structure.

## Section 3.2

There are no restrictions where board members must be token holders. Delta board members will be compensated based on investment performance and maintenance of day to day cash flow operations and the treasury/custodial assets. 

## Section 3.3

-Voting is done through an adaptive quorum with a minimum number of members = 3. The delta board must have >50% quorum for a vote. For example, if there are 9 board members, at least 5 must vote for the vote to count. 
-As the quorum grows, the percentage voting 'yes' decreases. For example, if there are 9 board members, if only 5 vote, all 5 must vote yes (100%). If 6 vote, 5 must vote yes (83.3%).... if 9 vote, 5 must vote yes (55.5%). 
-The voing period must last for no less than 2 weeks, only able to be cut short if the required votes are cast. 
-Once a stop-loss trigger is hit, the divestment does not require a vote.

## Section 3.4

The delta shall hold meetings no less often than once a calendar month for the board in order to review current investments, make sure that outstanding operational flows are reviewed and processed, discuss additional investment theses, discuss closure of any investments.

## Section 3.5

All proposed investments should have a delta board 'sponsor'. The sponsor is the entity that initally proposes the investment, and is responsible for monitoring the investment, and setting up the appropriate contacts/monitoring systems.

## Section 3.6

All proposed investments should have a specific sell trigger/stop loss attached. Example: a stablecoin investment should have a 'depeg' sale trigger, if stablecoin breaches 0.98 peg. Example: token investment must not breach 25% drawdown. Example: if lending pool saturation breaches 80%, pull lent assets out. 

## Section 3.7

Maintenance of asset/liability matching is a must. Understanding the time sensitive (duration) of outstanding liabilities should be appropriately matched with investment liquidity.

## Section 3.8
Performance reporting is a must. Monthly performance should be maintained and published to delta. 

## Section 3.9

-Delta board member compensation will be based on a split between asset based fee and performance based fee (some would call this a 2-20 structure, though not 2% and 20% respectively). 
-The asset based fee will be penalized/slashed if day-to-day operations are not handled appropriately.
-The performance based fee will have a hurdle rate (not a high water ) of 13%. Basis of calculating it will be the modified dietz method. (TBD)
-Many investments will purposefully not attempt to earn a performance fee since they will be used to fund shorter term expected expenses/liabilities. For example, audit contract payment at completion of audit could be held in stablecoins, potentially in a liquid lending protocol, with no expectation of earning 13%.
-Longer term investments not specifically bucketed for expenses/liabilities may attempt to earn a performance fee. These types of investments must have specific stop-loss triggers.

## Section 3.10

Key to overall portfolio management is understanding the diversification benefits of <1 correlation between assets.


# Article IV -- The Kairos

## Section 4.1

Infinite longevity of ODAO is the ultimate goal. Marginal growth with low volatility is preferred to all high risk/high reward investments. Have many low risk investment theses, with only a few tactical high risk implementations.

## Section 4.2

Diversification is the only free lunch, a mathematical certainty. 

## Section 4.3

Timing is everything, and nothing.
