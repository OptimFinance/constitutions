# Constitution of The Court, omega

## Preamble

The Court exists to ensure that the ecosystem as a whole's stance is aligned with the rest of the ODAO. As an observer of order, an impartial creator and executioner of law. They are to ensure that the dealings are just and the members treated fairly.

# Article I -- The Ethos

## Section 1.1

Remove chaos, individualistic superfluousness and unreasonable action.

## Section 1.2

Truth is relative, a contract is absolute.

## Section 1.3

Ego is an enemy of progress, a black swan looms over every action.

## Section 1.4

Definition is of utmost importance.

# Article II -- The Pathos

## Section 2.1

The power to change the social contract is akin to the power to change the truth and it is given to omega in trust by ODAO to ensure that the written word has meaning to it. This means that rules agreements and interpreatations thereof fall under omega's purview. 

## Section 2.2

Social Smart Contracts (SSC) are also custodied and oracled by omega. It is any contract, optionally augumented with a smart contract that is meant to be made between legal entities as defined in section 2 of ODAO constitution. 

## Section 2.3

SSC may charge an administrative fee to fund the expenditures appropriately set by the omega.

## Section 2.4

Decisions made on the execution of SSCs can be overturned by a lower layer. 


# Article III -- The Logos

## Section 3.1

The Court is a structure mirroring courts in real life, allowing a case to be disputed and taken up to a lower layer, in order to find a judgement closest to the values.

## Section 3.2

omega is divided into layers, outermost representing least trusted, innermost representing the most trusted. Each layer is staffed by entities that must reach a 5/7of the total weight of that layer's participants, one entity = 1 weight. An entity from a layer lower may participate in the vote with weight additional to the absolute difference between the layer numbers.

## Section 3.3

Requirement for introducing a new member to a layer is acceptance by that layer and a layer higher, defaulting to acceptance by lower layer if quorum is not met. Standard for that would be to elevate a member from a layer higher. 

## Section 3.4

Higher layers have delegated to them more mundane matters, coming down to the lowest layer only if necesary.

## Section 3.5

Decision must be made within 2 weeks per layer for every decision that needs to be made. Should the quorum not be reached the case is automatically given to a layer lower. 

# Article IV -- The Kairos

## Section 4.1

Law imposed on that of ODAO is meant to serve it, not the other way around.

## Section 4.2

The Court is meant to represent the view of the community at large. Move neither too slow nor too hasty.
