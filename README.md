# Constitutions of ODAO 

This repository holds the foundational documents that allow the ODAO to function properly and this document is meant to guide you through exploring them but by no means is meant to be an explaination of every single aspect of it. 

## [The ODAO Constiution](odao.md)

The document holds the shared substance between all that is of ODAO, citizens, brances and everything else. 

It is divided in 3 articles that pertain where is ODAO derived from, its structure, and the inhabitants of it. It establishes the 3-branch structure of itself and how power is divided between them and how they are to keep each other in check.

A more visual (older) version of the document with more context that goes through the  is here: [ODAO_OF_ALL_INTERESTS.pdf](ODAO_OF_ALL_INTERESTS.pdf)

## Constitutions of Branches

[The Core, alpha](odao-alpha.md)  
[The Council, Delta](odao-delta.md)  
[The Court, omega](odao-omega.md)

As established in the prior document, the branches themselves self-govern subject to only other branches' watchful eye. They each have their own constitution and behave as separate entities.

Each separate and distinct and yet they rhyme and are deliberately placed in contrast to one another. They are as much a manual for collaboration and dispute resolution as much as they are a constitution. 

Importantly, again, each branch presupposes the ODAO constitution. For the sake of clarity, notably, this includes the ability to delegate power and responsibility to a ministry. 

Article I, The Ethos, pertains to the mindset, a guideline for acting in stead of the branch. The three branches are placed on 3 axis, perspectives on 3 key differentiating issues, each placing one of the branches as the foci middle point.

Article II, The Pathos, explains the powers derived from ODAO over it and how they are to be used and by whom, including the information flow of them. 

Article III, The Logos, lays down the foundation for how the key decisions are taken and the key structure around the branch.

Article IV, The Kairos, gives context to everything. As the ODAO is invariant to time, but the branches are not, they must be able to evolve. Key points for operations included.
